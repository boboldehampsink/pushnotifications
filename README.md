=================

Plugin that allows you to register devices and send push notifications to them.

Features:
- Able to register platforms and device tokens per app and platform
- Keeps a history of sent messages
- Predefine commands to send with the notification payload
- If you install the [Cronjob Manager Plugin](http://github.com/boboldehampsink/cronjob) you can schedule notifications

Important:
The plugin's folder should be named "pushnotifications"

Deprecated
=================

With the release of Craft 3 on 4-4-2018, this plugin has been deprecated. You can still use this with Craft 2 but you are encouraged to use (and develop) a Craft 3 version. At this moment, I have no plans to do so.
